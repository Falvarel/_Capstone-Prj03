### IE &amp; ACCIONA - Sustainability Datathon 2023

3rd Place - Issued by Acciona & IE School of Science and Technology (Oct 2023)

The IE Sustainability Datathon 2023 was a competition sponsored by Acciona and the primary objective of it was to lead the transition toward a low-carbon economy while incorporating quality standards and innovative processes into all projects to optimize resource efficiency and environmental preservation.
Our team Ecominds, in collaboration with ACCIONA and IE School of Science and Technology, showcased groundbreaking work in data-driven sustainability efforts.

üîπ"Participating in the Sustainability Datathon and collaborating on the water consumption prediction challenge was a transformative experience. It underscored the critical role that data-driven solutions play in addressing pressing sustainability issues.

üîπThe impact of our work extends beyond this event. We recognize the opportunity to refine our predictive model further and collaborate with local authorities and stakeholders to implement our findings.

üîπThe Datathon not only enriched our technical skills but also fostered teamwork, problem-solving, and time management abilities. Overcoming challenges in a limited timeframe reinforced the value of effective collaboration and creative thinking".

üåç At a time when climate change is a pressing global challenge, it's incredibly rewarding to be part of an initiative that is actively seeking to make a real impact.

This achievement reflects not only our commitment to sustainability but also the importance of fresh, modern talent in shaping the future of business and technology. A special mention to Ecominds team members: Paola Aybar, Kateryna Rovinska, Denisa Cekrezi, and Ben van Balen.
